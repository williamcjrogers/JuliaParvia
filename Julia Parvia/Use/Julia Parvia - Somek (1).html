During my midwifery career, I have developed a wealth of experience across a number of aspects of midwifery care. More recently, I have rotated across high risk labour ward, low risk birthing centre, antenatal maternity assessment unit, postnatal ward and community. My current post is a Band 6 Senior Midwife.</p><p style="padding-top: 5pt;text-indent: 0pt;text-align: left;"><br/></p><p style="padding-left: 24pt;text-indent: 0pt;line-height: 143%;text-align: left;">Previously on the midwifery led unit, I have worked as a Band 7 Senior Midwife. I was responsible for the delivery of care from a team of midwives for which I was manager too. My role now remains that of a Senior Midwife. My skills include all aspects of antenatal and postnatal care, hospital antenatal care, triage – telephone and face to face, intrapartum (labour) care which includes low risk midwifery on the MLU as well as high risk labour care on the delivery suite, with experience in high risk CTG interpretation and escalation, use of oxytocin, and extensive suturing skills and experience. I provide postnatal care to women and babies, both low and high risk, and I am trained in the newborn</p><p style="padding-top: 5pt;padding-left: 24pt;text-indent: 0pt;text-align: left;">examination of the neonate.</p><p style="padding-top: 5pt;text-indent: 0pt;text-align: left;"><br/></p><p style="padding-left: 24pt;text-indent: 0pt;line-height: 143%;text-align: left;">When in the community I provide antenatal and postnatal care, running clinics including all aspects of maternal and foetal observations to ensure wellbeing, and home visits within the postnatal period with all mother and baby checks and necessary referrals. I have previously held a caseload of women with full responsibility for their care from booking, throughout their pregnancy, including all health screening to identify category of risk and liaising with the hospital ante natal clinic. Care is provided within both clinic and in-home environment providing women centred support, ensuring safe delivery for mum and baby. I also covered the home birth on call rota. This included going to women’s homes to provide intrapartum and post-natal care during their labour and following. This included safe delivery of the baby whilst monitoring both maternal and foetal observations and detecting normal and abnormal boundaries and acting quickly and competently when these arose.</p><p style="padding-top: 12pt;padding-left: 24pt;text-indent: 0pt;text-align: left;">Both within the community and hospital setting, I am involved in safeguarding women and babies</p><p style="padding-top: 5pt;padding-left: 24pt;text-indent: 0pt;line-height: 143%;text-align: left;">and have a varied social and cultural community caseload. I am a senior assessor in the mentorship of student midwives and a preceptor of midwifery colleagues, regularly providing constructive feedback promoting improvements to processes, procedures and behaviours. I was previously a Supervisor of Midwives.</p><p style="padding-top: 12pt;padding-left: 24pt;text-indent: 0pt;line-height: 143%;text-align: left;">I have undertaken medico-legal training on the NHSR Early Notification Scheme, and I also teach this training to expert midwives within Somek &amp; Associates. This has given me a breadth of knowledge surrounding these cases and I am able to assist with casework of this nature, having undertaken many ENS cases and attended the conferences for the same. I accept instructions from both claimant and defendant solicitors and insurers. I have undergone formal training in the medico-legal process and am fully aware of my responsibilities under Civil Procedure Rules (CPR) pertaining to expert witnesses.</p></body></html>
