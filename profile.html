                    <h2>Julia Parvia</h2>
                    <p class="lead"><strong>Profession:</strong> Registered Midwife</p>
                    <p><strong>Qualifications:</strong> Professional Midwifery Advocate Level 7, MSc Midwifery, BSc
                        Midwifery, Dip Nursing</p>

                    <h2>Professional Experience</h2>
                    <p>I qualified as a Registered Nurse in 2003 and as a Midwife in 2005. Since then, I have gained
                        extensive experience across all areas of midwifery, including antenatal, intrapartum, and
                        postnatal care. I currently work as a Band 6 Senior Midwife, rotating across high-risk labour
                        wards, low-risk birthing centres, antenatal assessment units, postnatal wards, and community
                        settings. My clinical competencies include high-risk CTG interpretation, escalation protocols,
                        oxytocin administration, and advanced perineal suturing. I am also trained in the newborn
                        physical examination.</p>
                    <p>In the community, I provide antenatal and postnatal care through clinics and home visits,
                        conducting maternal and fetal assessments, identifying risk factors, and making appropriate
                        referrals. I have previously held a full caseload, managing care from booking through to
                        delivery, including home births. This involved intrapartum care in the home setting, monitoring
                        maternal and fetal wellbeing, and responding promptly to deviations from the norm. I have also
                        worked as a Band 7 Senior Midwife on a midwifery-led unit, where I managed a team and was
                        responsible for the safe delivery of care.</p>
                    <p>I have significant experience in safeguarding and managing complex social and cultural caseloads.
                        I regularly support junior colleagues and students, providing structured feedback and promoting
                        clinical development. I was formerly a Supervisor of Midwives.</p>

                    <h2>Medico-Legal Experience</h2>
                    <p>I accept instructions from both claimant and defendant solicitors and insurers. I have undergone
                        formal training in the medico-legal process and am fully aware of my responsibilities under
                        Civil Procedure Rules (CPR) pertaining to expert witnesses.</p>
                    <p>I have in depth knowledge of NHS Resolution Early Notification Scheme (ENS) and I deliver
                        training on this subject to expert midwives at Somek & Associates.</p>
                    <p>I have given oral evidence as an expert witness at Coroners Inquest and Fitness to Practice
                        hearings.</p>
